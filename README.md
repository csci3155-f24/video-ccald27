# Project Title
Unity/C#, Related to PPL Topics
## Description

Using Unity to demonstrate PPL concepts used in the game world. Unity Library is built on the C# framework, but my goal is to focus on library methods and types specific to the Unity library. Some C# reference/methods mentioned. Primary goal of this project is to visualize these changes or concepts being used in real-time in Unity's game editor (with the game 'running'). Some concepts cannot be visualized, but I attempted to give some visualization for every concept covered.
